			<h2>What is Zero-sum Game? </h2>
			<p>In game theory and economic theory, a zero-sum game is a mathematical representation of a situation in which <b>an advantage that is won by one of two sides is lost by the other</b>. If the total gains of the participants are added up, and the total losses are subtracted, they will sum to zero. Thus, cutting a cake, where taking a more significant piece reduces the amount of cake available for others as much as it increases the amount available for that taker, is a zero-sum game if all participants value each unit of cake equally. Other examples of zero-sum games in daily life include games like poker, chess, and bridge where one person gains and another person loses, which results in a zero-net benefit for every player. In the markets and financial instruments, futures contracts and options are zero-sum games as well. Nevertheless, the situation like the stock market etc. is not a zero-sum game because investors could gain profit or loss from share price influences by profit forecasts or economic outlooks rather than gain profit from other investors lost.</p>
			<p>In contrast, non-zero-sum describes a situation in which the interacting parties' aggregate gains and losses can be less than or more than zero. A zero-sum game is also called a <i>strictly competitive game</i>, while non-zero-sum games can be either competitive or non-competitive. Zero-sum games are most often solved with the minimax theorem which is closely related to linear programming duality, or with <b>Nash equilibrium</b>.</p>
			<p><b>Prisoner's Dilemma</b> is a classical non-zero-sum game.</p>
